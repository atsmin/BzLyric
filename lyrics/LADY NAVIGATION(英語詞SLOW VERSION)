Hands with fire
Stickin' to the stained sky
White desire and deep affection fill her crown
She never turns her hair
when we're driven out to empty dreams by a big wave of mode
Now everybody stop and look before you're drowned
The state of independence reflected in her eyes
LADY NAVIGATION
I'm watching over you pray on the sea
Teardrops of sensation
falling into the waves drift to the East I'm watchin' over you
Ain't no closed mind
she's just gonna have no prejudice
Across the borderline
Give me a kiss of liberty
Anything in her sight would be full of life
primitive pleasure everywhere
Won't be satisfired with tow-bit gossip anymore
Gotta go to get the steering wheel of my own
LADY NAVIGATION
I'm watching over you pray on the sea
Teardrops of sensation
falling into the waves drift to the East
I'm watchin' over you
Please come along to me
