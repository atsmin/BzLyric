Orange is the sky the sun's going down
I feel like running away from here
Gentle is the wind cooling the town
There is no other place to go
Baby, since you left me alone
All the light has gone
Sometimes it's hard to breathe
Now everything has changed
I'm losing a part of me
Oh, Let the candle burn again
So close to the edge When will I find my way
Oh, Let my soul fly again
Need to find the road leading to a brighter day
Music in the street on Saturday night
I hear the laughter of joy
Sorrow comes from nowhere, gripping me tight
Will it ever let me go
I try to think about love
What you gave to me
It's always within my heart
The past it taught me to live
Now it is time for me to change
Oh, Let the candle burn again
So close to the edge When will I find my way
Oh, Let my soul fly again
Need to find the road leading to a brighter day
Oh, I feel my soul fly again
Was close to the edge I almost lost my way
Oh, I feel the candle burn again
Now I've found the road leading me to brighter days
