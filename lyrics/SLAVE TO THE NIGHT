You know that
I've been so lonely,
No matter
how much you care
So you think that
you have seen me
but you never
touch my truth
Somebody's got
the keys to everywhere
For just a while
Playing with
a stranger
Throw away the time
I'm a
SLAVE TO THE NIGHT
A child of the moon,
blue temptation
is calling you
Don't you go away,
it's alright
I'll give you
anything,
just keep on paying
for your love
OH you're a
SLAVE TO THE NIGHT
Breathe in the dark,
I know where
I would like to be
Don't you go away,
it's alright
I'll give you
anything,
and I can bury
all my tears
in the white sand
Hey!
Mm… I'll give you,
baby… baby
Mm…
Anything is wrong
Mm…
You've never
seen before
Yes,I'm a
SLAVE TO THE NIGHT
A child of the moon,
blue temptation
is calling you
Don't you go away,
it's alright
I'll give you
anything,
just keep on paying
for your love
OH you're a
SLAVE TO THE NIGHT
Breathe in the dark,
I know where
I would like to be
Don't you go away,
it's alright
I'll give you
anything,
and I can bury
all my tears Yeah
Just keep on paying
wherever you go
Come and take
my hands my baby
