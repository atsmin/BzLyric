Thought love was on your mind,
but found nothing of the kind
There is something missing,
baby something just not right
Is it time? Or is it money?
I don't know wow wow wow…
Waiting for the chime
The sign to tell the time
We've got no revelation
We're as free as we can be
Movin' out, an' movin' in
We say wow wow wow…
Now where do we go?
Just face to face
And don't turn your eyes away from the truth
Nothing to fear
Just you & I
So let's make sure what's goin' on
Hey, hey, say you love it,
right now, let it all out
You don't need to hide away
Just tell me what you're thinkin'
Hey, hey, say you hate it,
right now, let it all off
I wanna get to know you better
Let me see your naked eyes
Hey, hey, I say I love it, right now,
I'll let it all out
Always gonna keep in touch
So hurry up, come on baby!
Hey, hey, I say I hate it, right now,
I'll let it all off
Wow wow wow… Bad Communication!
I can hear your thing,
You can hear me sing
We can get along together,
we can make it through
So say yeah, yeah alright
We say wow wow wow…
Now where do we go?
Just face to face
And don't turn your eyes away from the truth
Nothing to fear
Just you & I
So let's make sure what's goin' on
Hey, hey, say you love it,
right now, let it all out
You don't need to hide away
Just tell me what you're thinkin'
Hey, hey, say you hate it,
right now, let it all off
I wanna get to know you better
Let me see your naked eyes
Hey, hey, I say I love it, right now,
I'll let it all out
Always gonna keep in touch
So hurry up, come on baby!
Hey, hey, I say I hate it, right now,
I'll let it all off
Wow wow wow… Bad Communication!
