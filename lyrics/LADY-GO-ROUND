Rain, why don't you come another day
You know I'm going on my lonely trip
I can't believe
She's gotta move to another guy
No time to realize our love was incomplete
Tomorrow I'll be another man
I'm sure I've learned from my mistakes
Sweet and bitter days made me so strong
that I can live without her, now I've gotta go
Lady-go-round, still I got so many girls
There's enough to go around
Like Merry-go-round, we have our pick of the lot
But you know, I can't give her up now

Rain, don't you please go away
You've gotta give me anything to hold on
Don't you stop! Your sound beating the windows never cheer me up
But laugh at the man who lost the girl again
Tomorrow I'll be another man
Never I'm in love with myself
Just listen to me, raindrops, it's you, baby
So please don't take me to whistle in the dark
Lady-go-round, even she got many guys
There's enough to go around
Like Merry-go-round, everyday man's going round
But you know, I won't forget her eyes
